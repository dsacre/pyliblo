2008-03-03: Version 0.7.0

 * Fixed memory leaks, caused by failure to free() the result of
   lo_server_get_url() and lo_address_get_url().
 * Added parameter to Server.register_methods() to allow registering
   functions of an object other than the server itself.
 * Allow callback functions to have a variable number of arguments (*args).

2007-12-14: Version 0.6.4

 * Avoid creating circular references when using methods as callback
   functions, which in some cases prevented the server object from being
   deleted properly.

2007-08-10: Version 0.6.3

 * Patched the Pyrex-generated code to make it compile without warnings.
 * Always build from the existing C source by default.

2007-07-29: Version 0.6.2

 * Minor code cleanup, hopefully not breaking anything.
 * Somewhat faster conversion of blob data from and to Python lists.

2007-07-07: Version 0.6.1

 * Fixed a bug that caused the floats 0.0 and 1.0 to be sent as boolean.
   Thanks to Jesse Chappell for the patch.

2007-05-20: Version 0.6

 * Added support for sending bundles, optionally with timestamps.
 * Added previously unsupported OSC data types (timetag, midi, symbol,
   true/false/nil/infinitum).
 * New @make_method decorator.
 * Various bugfixes.

2007-04-28: Version 0.5.1

 * Fixed a stupid typo in Server.send().

2007-04-26: Version 0.5

 * Simplified the way arguments are passed to callback functions. For the
   server side, this release is therefore incompatible with previous versions!
 * Some more cleanup.

2007-04-02: Version 0.3

 * Added class ServerThread for asynchronous dispatching of incoming messages.

2007-04-01: Version 0.2

 * Minor improvements.

2007-02-20: Version 0.1

 * Initial release.
